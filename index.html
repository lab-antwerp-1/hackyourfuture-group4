          <p>
            Our journey will last for 8 months where we go through 12 modules,
            the most challenging the last module where you can collaborate with
            with one of our partners to build your own project. Our training is
            in Brussels, Antwerp, and soon in many other places. Our program is
            most effective when its combined with your self-study, peer
            learning, and our devoted coaches.

            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>
              We’re largely dependent on volunteers. That’s what makes us an
              engaged grassroots community, as our students call it ‘the HYF
              family’.

            <h2>Diversity</h2>
            <p>
              Our program is adapted to suit people with different backgrounds,
              often in vulnerable situations. We teach on Sundays to allow
              everyone to take control of their personal lives during the week.

            <h2>Commitment</h2>
            <p>
              Our program is free of charge, although we ask for strong
              commitment during our 7 month-journey. And you know what? Many
              alumni stay actively involved!

              Sharing is caring. Our curriculum is 100% open. We believe in
              knowledge for the many, not the few.
