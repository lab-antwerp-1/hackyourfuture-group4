# Hack Your Future

> only `must have` user stories need to be in the development strategy

A renewed website for hack your future

---

## Webpage design

- We will simplify the work by dividing home page into sections

## Title of website

> "As a user I can read the title as a logo"

## Home page navbar

> "As a user I can see a nice navbar at top of home page"

> "AS a user I can see an apply button"

### Issues

1- HTML:

- [ ] use `nav` to include the navigation bar.
- [ ] use `ul` and `li` to add the navigation links.

2- CSS:

- [ ] use `right` align to place the logo.
- [ ] use `blue` color hover.
- [ ] use `fontawesome` as font type.

## Body of home page

- As a user I can see different sections about the website-

  - [ ] We will make sections into issues that can be assigned to members.

### Issues

1- HTML:

- [ ] use `section` to divide home page in sections.
- [ ] use `div`, `p` and `h1`to add descriptions on each section.

  2- CSS:

- [ ] use `class` to organize each section.
- [ ] use `blue` color hover.
- [ ] use `fontawesome` as font type.

## Navbar in every page except Apply form page

- Navbar with navigation links into different pages.

### Issues

1- HTML:

## Footer in every page except Apply form page

> "As a user I can see Social Media account links in footer part of each
> mentioned page"
